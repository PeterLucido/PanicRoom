## Objective of the App

PanicRoom is your digital haven to face and document your fears. Whether you've already conquered these fears or are still working to overcome them, adding them to your list is the first step toward liberation. The goal is simple but powerful: keep expanding your inventory and continue your journey. Each fear conquered is a stepping stone to a more robust, more resilient life.
